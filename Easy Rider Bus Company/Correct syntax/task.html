<h2>Description</h2>

<p>You managed to fill in all the missing data and correct the mistakes with the types. However, you noticed that there are multiple problems with suffix names for the stops: sometimes they are incorrect, and sometimes they are simply missing. As if that was not enough, you also realized that there are errors in the arrival times.</p>

<p>It seems like you have to carefully look at the entire "Format" column in the first part of the documentation.</p>

<p>Here are the documents that you have: <a target="_blank" href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/412967/Documentation.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">documentation</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/412967/Diagram_of_the_bus_line.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">diagram of the bus lines</a>.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
	<li>The string containing the data in JSON format is passed to standard input.</li>
	<li>Check that the data format complies with the documentation. </li>
	<li>Only the fields that have such a requirement are relevant.</li>
	<li>Like in the previous stage, print the information about the number of found errors in total and in each field.</li>
	<li>The output should have the same formatting as shown in the example.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can't find the necessary information in the stage description, it can probably be found in the attached documentation.</p>

<p>Note that the time format is military time (24 hours, <code class="language-json">hh:mm</code>), which does not mean that all the digits are present. Keep in mind certain restrictions: for example, the first digit cannot be 3, 4, and so on.</p>
